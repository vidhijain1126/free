            <p>Creating a bootable Kali Linux USB drive in a Linux environment is easy. Once you’ve downloaded and verified your Kali ISO file, you can use the dd command to copy it over to your USB drive using the following procedure. Note that you’ll need to be running as root, or to execute the dd command with sudo.</p> 
            <p>The following example assumes a Linux Mint 17.1 desktop - depending on the distro you’re using, a few specifics may vary slightly, but the general idea should be very similar. If you would prefer to use Etcher, then follow the same directions as a Windows user. Note that the USB drive will have a path similar to /dev/sdb.</p>
            <p>WARNING: Although the process of imaging Kali Linux onto a USB drive is very easy, you can just as easily overwrite a disk drive you didn’t intend to with dd if you do not understand what you are doing, or if you specify an incorrect output path. Double-check what you’re doing before you do it, it’ll be too late afterwards.</p>

            <p>One of the fastest method, for getting up and running with Kali Linux is to run it “live” from a USB drive. This method has several advantages</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A verified copy of the appropriate ISO image of the latest Kali build image for the system you’ll be running it on</li>
                <li>If you’re running under Windows, there is no one tool that is considered the overall best for imaging. We recommend Etcher (installer or portable) as it is simpler to use, however Rufus is another popular option with its advanced options. If one does not work for you, consider the other.</li>
                <li>A USB drive, 8GB or larger (Systems with a direct SD card slot can use an SD card with similar capacity. The procedure is identical.)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It’s non-destructive - it makes no changes to the host system’s hard drive or installed OS, and to go back to normal operations, you simply remove the Kali Live USB drive and restart the system</p>
            <p>It’s portable - you can carry Kali Linux in your pocket and have it running in minutes on an available system</p>
            <p>It’s customizable - you can roll your own custom Kali Linux ISO image and put it onto a USB drive using the same procedures</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Plug your USB drive into an available USB port on your Windows PC, note which drive designator (e.g. “G:\”) it uses once it mounts, and launch Etcher.</li>
                <li>Click Flash from file, and locate the Kali Linux ISO file to be imaged with.</li>
                <li>Click Select target and choose the USB drive you want to make bootable.</li>
                <li>Click the Flash! button once ready.</li>
                <li>Once Etcher alerts you that the image has been flashed, you can safely remove the USB drive and proceed to boot into Kali with it.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>After writing the image to the USB drive, reboot Windows with the USB inserted. Depending on the motherboard manufacture, will also depend on the next stage. Some motherboards support a “temporary” boot menu, allowing for a one off selection.</p>
            <p>Others you need to enter BIOS/UEFI to configure it to try and boot from USB first. Entering either location, also depends on the motherboard.</p> 
            <p>You can look up on the manufacture’s website and read the manual, try and read the screen when booting (however the text may be shown too quick or full logos used), or try common key combinations (such as ESC, F1, F2, F3, F4, F8, F10, F11, F12 or DEL).</p>
